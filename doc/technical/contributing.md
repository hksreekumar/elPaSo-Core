# Contributing

You are welcome to contribute to the project. Please create a new development branch with name `alpha-<YOUR_FEATURENAME>` (see git branching strategy illustration below) and push your commits. Finally, create a merge request to branch "beta" when your feature is ready to be integrated. We encourage you to merge a stable version of your feature regularly to avoid incompatibility issues.
