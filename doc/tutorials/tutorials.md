# Tutorials ðŸŽ“

The Learning Tutorials is a guide aimed towards educating the user about FEM capabilities of elPaSo. In order to familiarize the user with elPaSo routines, some simple academic examples are discussed here in detail. Each and every step of which is shown in the form of text and pictures. The examples are structured in a way that in the beginning of every example some assumptions are made to define the model, followed by the procedure used to analyse the model in accordance with the problem statement. At the end of each example the results are disused in conclusion section.
 
With each example the complexity increases, hence it is recommended to follow the examples in the given order. After performing these examples user should be able to analyse not only simple academic problems but also extend the scope to complex acoustic problems with FEM capabilities of elPaSo. 

Following are the available tutorials:
