## About

The research code “Elementary Parallel Solver (elPaSo)” is the in-house vibroacoustic simulation tool constantly developed over 25 years at TU Braunschweig, presently extended and maintained by the Institute for Acoustics (InA), TU Braunschweig. The tool is used extensively for research and teaching for many years. The whole elPaSo project includes the core software written in C++ and other assisting in-house tools written in python. elPaSo offers a wide range of features (see Features and Capability) and facilitates efficient computations in HPC clusters to support parallel computing of large-scale high-fidelity vibroacoustic models. Moreover, the project is built on a flexible and modular framework to support new research features and potential collaborations. Interested? Please get in touch with us for more information.

Please refer to the [User Documentation](../theory/utility.md) for details or [Technical Documentation](../technical/technical.md) to know about contributing as a developer.

## How can you use elPaSo?

elPaSo Core is can be used in two ways according to your purpose:

1. <b>eCore Executable</b>: The executable can be used to solve vibroacoustic problems.
2. <b>eCore Library</b>: By generating eCore library, you can link eCore as a third party library in your project and use the FEM functionalies from eCore.

See our repository at [elPaSo Core project](https://git.rz.tu-bs.de/akustik/elPaSo-Core).
