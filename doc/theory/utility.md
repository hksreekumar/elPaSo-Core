Welcome to the user guide for elPaSo. The documentation includes detailed information on the various functionalities and notes from its developers. Tutorials are also included to get started with the elPaSo workflow.

elPaSo implementations are provided to users and developers in two different modules: <b>elPaSo Core (eCore)</b> module and <b>elPaSo Research (eResearch)</b> module.
